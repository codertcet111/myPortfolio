                    What to say, I consider it as my biggest achievement
                    <br>In parallel with my job I started a business, where I went to my elder sister's office just to meet people,
                    <br>I went to BDB, a business complex in Bandra, Mumbai for all diamond companies in mumbai.
                    <br>After spending some good time with few people I realised I can make some softwares and can sell to many businesses here
                    <br>I build 2 softwares,
                    <br>1. <a href="https://thawing-inlet-89107.herokuapp.com/">Ecommerce diamond platform with advance filters (Demo link)</a> : 
                    <br>-> It is a complete diamond purchase platform, 
                    <br>-> with Admin portal to monitor inventory and orders
                    <br>-> Have advance diamond filter

                    <br>2. Another software for Accounting
                    <br>-> It was to manage accounts
                    <br>-> create ledger, manage pay and money flow
                    <br>-> Kind of Tally but with flexibilty

                    <br>For above 2 softwares I had learned Accounting and Diamond entire self learn course

                    <br>Fianlly were able to sell softwares to 2 companies,
                    <br>total revenue was: 1 laks + 4 lakh = 5 lakh
                    <br>plus every year some thousand rupees benifits for maintenance

                    <br>I had hired one resource and paid 20K INR one time only for some small efforts since then my software were ready

                    <br>We did Requiremnt gathering, Development, Deployment, Sales, Setup, KT to users.
                    <br>Biggest learning

                    <br>But after sometime, due to high work pressure in regular job I had to quite this business,
                    <br>Actually there were more reasons to quite,
                    <br>-> Very less conversion rate, had reached to more than 40 offices so CR: 2/40 only
                    <br>-> In the BDB premises some well established companies were already exists and most of the offices had trust on those organisations rather on new player

                    <br>I could have put more efforts if there were no increase in work load in my regulat job

                    <br>Will Resume this again for Sure....
