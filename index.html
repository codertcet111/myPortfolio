                    This is my biggest failure in my life, as in parallel with my job I was preparing for GRE and TOEFL, exams to get admission into USA/CANADA universities for Master course
                    I gave GRE 2 times and Toefl also 2 times, but were able to secure only 309 in GRE and 89 in TOEFL after taking maximum from both attempts
                    After applying to multiple university in USA and CANADA I finally got acceptance letter and i20 from 3 universities
                    But my education loan was not sanctioned and i failed
                    I load over roughly 2 lakhs INR 2 to 2.5K USD and finally dropped plan (I lost my 10 months of salary)

                    What to say, I consider it as my biggest achievement
                    In parallel with my job I started a business, where I went to my elder sister's office just to meet people,
                    I went to BDB, a business complex in Bandra, Mumbai for all diamond companies in mumbai.
                    After spending some good time with few people I realised I can make some softwares and can sell to many businesses here
                    I build 2 softwares,
                    1. <a href="https://thawing-inlet-89107.herokuapp.com/">Ecommerce diamond platform with advance filters (Demo link)</a> : 
                    -> It is a complete diamond purchase platform, 
                    -> with Admin portal to monitor inventory and orders
                    -> Have advance diamond filter

                    2. Another software for Accounting
                    -> It was to manage accounts
                    -> create ledger, manage pay and money flow
                    -> Kind of Tally but with flexibilty

                    For above 2 softwares I had learned Accounting and Diamond entire self learn course

                    Fianlly were able to sell softwares to 2 companies,
                    total revenue was: 1 laks + 4 lakh = 5 lakh
                    plus every year some thousand rupees benifits for maintenance

                    I had hired one resource and paid 20K INR one time only for some small efforts since then my software were ready

                    We did Requiremnt gathering, Development, Deployment, Sales, Setup, KT to users.
                    Biggest learning

                    But after sometime, due to high work pressure in regular job I had to quite this business,
                    Actually there were more reasons to quite,
                    -> Very less conversion rate, had reached to more than 40 offices so CR: 2/40 only
                    -> In the BDB premises some well established companies were already exists and most of the offices had trust on those organisations rather on new player

                    I could have put more efforts if there were no increase in work load in my regulat job

                    Will Resume this again for Sure....
